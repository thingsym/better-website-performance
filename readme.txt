Small patches and bug reports can be submitted a issue tracker in Github. Forking on Github is another good way. You can send a pull request.

Translating a plugin takes a lot of time, effort, and patience. I really appreciate the hard work from these contributors.

If you have created or updated your own language pack, you can send gettext PO and MO files to author. I can bundle it into plugin.
